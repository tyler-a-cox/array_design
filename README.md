# Array Optimization for 21cm Cosmology

How do we best design an array to best handle systematics and gain calibration? This repository will attempt to use machine learning to optimize the array layout of radio interferometers for 21cm cosmology. While this repository is intended to be used to optimize array layouts for interferometers utilizing frequency redundant calibration, in principle it can be used to optimize layouts for a variety of calibration methods.

## Simulator

- `vis_gpu`

## Calibration Methods
- Absolute Calibration
- Redundant Calibration
- Frequency Redundant Calibration
- Correlation Calibration
